In Fortran, handling a 31-dimensional array involves using nested loops to manage operations like insertion, deletion, and updating. Since Fortran doesn't directly support dynamic arrays with more than 7 dimensions, you will typically use a one-dimensional array and map it to a 31-dimensional structure through indexing. Below is an example code snippet that demonstrates how you might handle such an array with insert, delete, and update operations.

### Example Fortran Code

```fortran
program Array31D
  implicit none
  integer, parameter :: N = 2
  integer, dimension(N**31) :: array
  integer :: indices(31)
  integer :: i, j, idx, value, pos
  
  ! Initialize array
  do i = 1, N**31
     array(i) = 0
  end do

  ! Function to calculate linear index
  idx = linear_index(indices, N)

  ! Insert value at a specific position (update)
  pos = 1234  ! Example position
  value = 42  ! Value to insert
  call insert(array, pos, value)

  ! Delete value at a specific position
  pos = 5678
  call delete(array, pos)

contains

  ! Function to calculate the linear index from 31D indices
  integer function linear_index(indices, N)
    integer, intent(in) :: indices(31), N
    integer :: i, index
    index = 1
    do i = 1, 31
      index = index + (indices(i) - 1) * N**(i-1)
    end do
    linear_index = index
  end function linear_index

  ! Subroutine to insert or update a value
  subroutine insert(arr, pos, val)
    integer, dimension(:), intent(inout) :: arr
    integer, intent(in) :: pos, val
    arr(pos) = val
  end subroutine insert

  ! Subroutine to delete a value (set it to zero)
  subroutine delete(arr, pos)
    integer, dimension(:), intent(inout) :: arr
    integer, intent(in) :: pos
    arr(pos) = 0
  end subroutine delete

end program Array31D
```

### Explanation

1. **Array Initialization:** 
   - The array is initialized with `N**31` elements. Here, `N` is the size of each dimension (you can change it according to your needs).
   
2. **Linear Index Calculation:**
   - The `linear_index` function calculates the linear index in the one-dimensional array from the 31-dimensional indices. This is crucial for mapping the multidimensional array to a one-dimensional array.

3. **Insert/Update:**
   - The `insert` subroutine inserts or updates a value at a specific position. The position is calculated based on the linear index.

4. **Delete:**
   - The `delete` subroutine sets the value at a specific position to zero, effectively deleting it.

### Usage
- This example assumes the array's size in each dimension is small due to the exponential growth of the total size with 31 dimensions. The array is linearized to handle operations, making it feasible to insert, delete, and update elements even in such high-dimensional cases.
